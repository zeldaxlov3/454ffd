      same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In
      a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like

      annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he
      rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
